The goal of `TheMarkUSA` is to make data cleaning and the creation of visualizations easier and faster for The Mark USA, Inc.
The functions in `TheMarkUSA` create visuals with The Mark USA branding and helper functions for
common data cleaning and manipulation tasks for use for everyone at The Mark USA, Inc.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `TheMarkUSA` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zcrowleyTheMark/TheMarkUSA")
```

## Usage

```{r load library}
library(TheMarkUSA)
```


To begin, it is best to convert our numeric data that we use at The Mark USA, Inc. to factor variables:

### `recodeCat()`

`recodeCat()` is a helper function to recode numeric data into factor variables with the desired levels.

`recodeCat()` takes in three arguments: 

**df** Required, a [tibble][tibble::tibble-package]/data frame of survey items that are numeric variables that need to be converted into factor variables.
Numeric variables in the data can be anywhere from 3 to 7 point scales.

**scale_labels** Required, a character vector of labels of the desired scale levels. The function will use this vector to convert the numeric variables into factor variables, must be arranged low to high with the exact number of levels as the data contains, or else NA will be returned. 

**number_levels** A character vector that of all the numeric values original numeric variables that are to be recoded, in the correct order.
Both scale_labels and number_levels should be in the same order that the user wants the variables to be recoded. For example, if
a variable from df has 3 numeric values of 1,2,and 3, to be recoded to as "Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate",
number_levels should equal: c(1,2,3) and scale_labels should equal: c("Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate"). See more examples below.
Defaults to NULL.

```{r recodeCat}
items <- dplyr::tibble(
  Pre_Organization = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1),
  Post_Organization = dplyr::if_else(Pre_Organization < 5, Pre_Organization + 1, Pre_Organization),
  Pre_Source = c(2, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2),
  Post_Source = dplyr::if_else(Pre_Source < 4, Pre_Source + 2, Pre_Source),
  Pre_Publish = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3),
  Post_Publish = Pre_Publish + 2,
  Pre_Write = c(2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4),
  Post_Write = Pre_Write + 1,
  Pre_Research = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4),
  Post_Research = Pre_Research + 1
)
# scale_labels for 5 item example
levels_min_ext <- c("Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate", "Good", "Extensive")
cat_items_1 <- TheMarkUSA::recodeCat(df = items, scale_labels = levels_min_ext, number_levels = c(1,2,3,4,5))
cat_items_1
```

The user simply passes a data frame of all the items to be recoded with a character vector of the 5 scale likert levels in the corresponding order as the numeric data.

## Data Visualizations Examples

`TheMarkUSA` currently contains three helper functions for generating visualizations: `stackedBarChart()`, `divBarChart()`, and `arrowChart()`.

### `stackedBarChart()`

`stackedBarChart()` creates a fully stacked bar chart that has the branding/style of The Mark USA, Inc.

`stackedBarChart()` takes up to 8 arguments, first 2 are *required*: 

**df** Required, A [tibble][tibble::tibble-package] or data frame of survey items that are categorical/factor variables, in 5 point scales, can be a single time point or pre-post, that will be inserted into a stacked bar chart with The Mark USA branding.

**scale_labels** Required, a character vector of levels to set the scale for the plot, accepts a character vector of 3 to 7 items.

**pre_post** Logical, default is FALSE. If true, returns a pre-post stacked bar chart, arranged by question, this requires data structured as pre-post. If FALSE, returns a stacked bar chart of a single time point.

**overall_n** Logical, default is FALSE. If TRUE, returns an overall *n* for all questions that is in the upper left tag of the plot. If False, adds *n* to each question/item after the respective labels.

**percent_label** Logical, default is TRUE. Labels the bars based on percentages. If FALSE, labels the bars with the number of answers per response.

**question_labels** Default is NULL. Takes in a named character vector to both supply labels the questions and sort the order of the questions.  The named character vector should have the new labels as the "name" and the old labels as the "variable" sorted in the desired order of appearing in the plot, first item will appear at the top of the plot. See examples.

**question_order** Logical, default is FALSE. If TRUE, the question order will be taken from the user supplied named character vector passed to
question_labels, where the first item will be at the top of the plot and so on. If FALSE, the question order will be the questions with highest
positive valenced response options on the top of the plot descending.

**width** Input a value between 0.3 and 0.8 to set the thickness of the bars. Default is NULL.

#### **Examples using** `stackedBarChart()`

#### Single Time Point Data with Percentage labels Example for `stackedBarChart()`:

```{r stackedBarChart_single}
# Single time point data:
items_single <- dplyr::tibble(
  Organization = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1),
  Source = c(2, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2),
  Publish = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3),
  Write = c(2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4),
  Research = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)
)
# scale_labels as a character vector, items in correct order:
levels_min_ext <- c("Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate", "Good", "Extensive")
# Question labels as a named vector with the naming structure like this: c("{new label}" = "{original variable name}"):
question_labels <- c("Publish a lot of high quality papers" =  "Publish",
                     "Write a lot of research papers" = "Write",
                     "Research in a lab with faculty" = "Research",
                     "Organization of a large research project" = "Organization",
                     "Source work for a research paper" = "Source")
# Recode the numeric to factor variables using the levels from levels_min_ext:
cat_items_single <- TheMarkUSA::recodeCat(items_single, levels_min_ext)
# Select the factor variables:
cat_items_single <- cat_items_single %>% dplyr::select(dplyr::where(is.factor))
# Pass the factor variables and the levels to 'stackedBarChart()':
stacked_chart_single <- TheMarkUSA::stackedBarChart(
   df = cat_items_single, pre_post = FALSE, scale_labels = levels_min_ext,
   percent_label = TRUE, width = 0.6
)
stacked_chart_single
# With new labels and order taken from question_labels argument:
stacked_chart_single_labels <- TheMarkUSA::stackedBarChart(
   df = cat_items_single, pre_post = FALSE, scale_labels = levels_min_ext,
   question_labels = question_labels, question_order = TRUE, percent_label = TRUE, width = 0.6
)
stacked_chart_single_labels
```


#### Pre-Post Data Example for `stackedBarChart()`

```{r stackedBarChart_pre_post}
# Select only the categorical/factor vars from the df in the from the oriinal recodeCat() in the first chunk (cat_items_1) using select(tidyselect::where(is.factor):
cat_items_plot <- cat_items_1 %>% dplyr::select(tidyselect::where(is.factor))

# Run the function with the factor items and the character vector of the factor levels:
stacked_chart_pre_post <- TheMarkUSA::stackedBarChart(
   df = cat_items_plot, pre_post = TRUE, scale_labels = levels_min_ext,
   percent_label = TRUE, width = NULL
)
stacked_chart_pre_post
# With new labels and order taken from question_labels argument:
stacked_chart_pre_post_labels <- TheMarkUSA::stackedBarChart(
   df = cat_items_plot, pre_post = TRUE, scale_labels = levels_min_ext,
   question_labels = question_labels, question_order = TRUE, percent_label = TRUE, width = NULL
)
stacked_chart_pre_post_labels
```

### `divBarChart()`

`divBarChart()` creates a diverging and fully stacked bar chart that has the branding and style of The Mark USA, Inc.

`divBarChart()` takes in up to 7 arguments, the first 2 are *required*: 

**df** Required, A [tibble][tibble::tibble-package]/data frame of survey items that are categorical/character
  variables, in 3 to 7 point scales, that will be inserted into a diverging bar chart with The Mark USA branding.

**scale_labels** Required, a character vector of levels to set the scale for the plot,
  accepts a character vector of 3 to 7 items.
  
**overall_n** Logical, default is FALSE. If TRUE, returns an overall *n* for all questions that is in the upper left tag of the plot. If False, adds *n* to each question/item after the respective labels.

**percent_label** Logical, default is TRUE. If FALSE, labels the bars with the number of answers per response.

**question_labels** Default is NULL. Takes in a named character vector to both supply labels the questions and sort the order of the questions.
  The named character vector should have the new labels as the "name" and the old labels as the "variable" sorted in the
  desired order of appearing in the plot, first item will appear at the top of the plot. See examples.
  
**question_order** Logical, default is FALSE. If TRUE, the question order will be taken from the user supplied named character vector passed to
   question_labels, where the first item will be at the top of the plot and so on. If FALSE, the question order will be the questions with highest
   positive valenced response options on the top of the plot descending.

**width** Input a value between 0.3 and 0.8 to set the thickness of the bars. Default is NULL.

#### **Examples using** `divBarChart()`

```{r divBarChart}
items <- dplyr::tibble(
 Pre_Organization = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1),
 Post_Organization = dplyr::if_else(Pre_Organization < 5, Pre_Organization + 1, Pre_Organization),
 Pre_Source = c(2, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2),
 Post_Source = dplyr::if_else(Pre_Source < 4, Pre_Source + 2, Pre_Source),
 Pre_Publish = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3),
 Post_Publish = Pre_Publish + 2,
 Pre_Write = c(2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4),
 Post_Write = Pre_Write + 1,
 Pre_Research = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4),
 Post_Research = Pre_Research + 1
)
levels_min_ext <- c("Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate", "Good", "Extensive")
# Question labels as a named vector with the naming structure like this: c("{new label}" = "{original variable name}"):
question_labels <- c("Publish a lot of high quality papers" =  "Publish",
                    "Write a lot of research papers" = "Write",
                    "Research in a lab with faculty" = "Research",
                    "Organization of a large research project" = "Organization",
                    "Source work for a research paper" = "Source")
# Recode the numeric to factor variables using the levels from levels_min_ext:
cat_items <- TheMarkUSA::recodeCat(items, levels_min_ext)
# Select the factor variables:
cat_items <- cat_items %>% dplyr::select(dplyr::where(is.factor))
# Pass the factor variables and the levels to 'divBarChart()', set so that it 
# returns the percent labels on the bars:
div_chart <- divBarChart(
 df = cat_items, scale_labels = levels_min_ext, percent_label = TRUE
)
div_chart
# With new labels and order taken from question_labels argument:
div_chart_labels <- divBarChart(
 df = cat_items, scale_labels = levels_min_ext,
 question_labels = question_labels, question_order = TRUE, percent_label = TRUE, width = NULL
)
div_chart_labels
```

### `arrowChart()`

`arrowChart()` takes in 6 arguments, the first 3 are *required*: 

**df** Required, a [tibble][tibble::tibble-package] or data frame of **numeric** data that also has a categorical group
 variable to split up the data, e.g. role, gender, education level, etc. must be in 5 point scales and pre-post.

**scale_labels** Required, a character vector of levels to set the scale for the plot.

**group_colors** Required, a character vector of hex codes for colors to associate
   each group to, e.g. this data has two groups and this function creates an
   overall group so this function will need a 'group_colors' character vector of
   three colors. 'group_colors' need to be in the order you want them associated to
   the group based on the factor levels for the group variable, last color
   will be the overall group of "all"

**overall_n** Logical, default is FALSE. If TRUE, returns an overall *n* for all questions that is in the upper left tag of the plot.
   If False, adds *n* to each question/item after the respective labels.
   
**question_labels** Default is NULL. Takes in a named character vector to both supply labels the questions and sort the order of the questions.
   The named character vector should have the new labels as the "name" and the old labels as the "variable" sorted in the
   desired order of appearing in the plot, first item will appear at the top of the plot. See examples.
   
**question_order** Logical, default is FALSE. If TRUE, the question order will be taken from the user supplied named character vector passed to
   question_labels, where the first item will be at the top of the plot and so on. If FALSE, the question order will be the questions with highest
   post score average on the top of the plot descending.

`arrowChart()` creates an arrow chart from numeric data based on the pre-post averages for each group and the overall group for the whole data set with the branding and style of The Mark USA, Inc. `arrowChart()` sorts the chart with the highest post scores on the top and lowest on the bottom.

#### **Examples using** `arrowChart()`

```{r arrowChart}
# Select only the numeric variables from the df in the last chunk (cat_items_1) using tidy select(contains("cat")), adding a group variable that is set as a factor:
arrow_items <- cat_items_1 %>%
  dplyr::select(tidyselect::where(is.numeric)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    group = factor(c(
      "grad", "undergrad", "grad", "undergrad", "grad", "undergrad", "undergrad", "grad", "undergrad"
    ), levels = c("grad", "undergrad"))
  )

# Set up the labels for the x-axis, this will match the numeric response in the data:
levels_min_ext <- c("Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate", "Good", "Extensive")

# Question labels as a named vector with the naming structure like this: c("{new label}" = "{original variable name}"):
question_labels <- c("Publish a lot of high quality papers" =  "Publish",
                    "Write a lot of research papers" = "Write",
                    "Research in a lab with faculty" = "Research",
                    "Organization of a large research project" = "Organization",
                    "Source work for a research paper" = "Source")

# Set up a character vector of scale colors to pass to the argument group_colors:
threeScale_theMark_colors <- c("#79AB53", "#4B9FA6", "#2C2C4F")

# Example with n for each question and original labels:
arrow_chart_1 <- TheMarkUSA::arrowChart(df = arrow_items, scale_labels = levels_min_ext, group_colors = threeScale_theMark_colors,
     overall_n = FALSE, question_labels = NULL, question_order = FALSE)
arrow_chart_1

# With new labels, question_order = FALSE, and overall_n set to TRUE:
arrow_chart_labels_all_n <- TheMarkUSA::arrowChart(df = arrow_items, scale_labels = levels_min_ext, group_colors = threeScale_theMark_colors,
     overall_n = FALSE, question_labels = question_labels, question_order = FALSE)
arrow_chart_labels_all_n

# With new labels and order taken from question_labels argument, and overall_n set to FALSE:
arrow_chart_labels_all_n <- TheMarkUSA::arrowChart(df = arrow_items, scale_labels = levels_min_ext, group_colors = threeScale_theMark_colors,
     overall_n = FALSE, question_labels = question_labels, question_order = TRUE)
arrow_chart_labels_all_n
```


More functions and visuals will be added to `TheMarkUSA` package as needed, be sure to reach out with any ideas for the package or issues!
