\title{Recode Numeric Variables to Factor Variables}
\usage{
recodeCat(df, scale_labels, number_levels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Required, a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble}/data frame of survey items that are numeric variables that need to be converted
into factor variables, Can be anywhere from 3 to 7 point scales.}

\item{scale_labels}{Required, a character vector of labels of the desired scale levels. The function will use this vector to convert
the numeric variables into factor variables, must be arranged low to high with the exact number of levels as the data contains,
or else NA will be returned for variables outside the range of user supplied values.}

\item{number_levels}{A character vector that of all the numeric values original numeric variables that are to be recoded, in the correct order.
Both scale_labels and number_levels should be in the same order that the user wants the variables to be recoded. For example, if
a variable from df has 3 numeric values of 1,2,and 3, to be recoded to as "Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate",
number_levels should equal: c(1,2,3) and scale_labels should equal: c("Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate"). See more examples below.
Defaults to NULL.}
}
\value{
a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} with the original numeric variables along with
new variables that are now factors with the prefix "cat_{variable_name}", with levels taken from scale_labels character
vector.
